# events  
 A mobile calendar application that allows the user to create and save their events locally on their android device. The application prototype was designed in Invision Studios and developed with Flutter and Dart.


  
## InVision Prototype 
  
With the InVision Prototype, I was able to visualize the possible outcome of my app. A UI implementation i could strive towards. The app was initially called **Tasks**. This remained till i had to rebuild the project from scratch due to compromised files. The new project would be refactored as ***Events***. Below is a recording of the prototype.

## Flutter and Dart

Flutter is a UI toolkit developed with the Dart Programming Language. The framework allows for cross-platform development from a single code base. Flutter also comes with a repository of packages that can be used to build your apps.

Events used several packages such as **table_calendar, intl, & shared_prefrences** to successfully build the app.

## Android Studio

Android Studio provided tools that aided in learning and building **Events** as fast and efficiently as possible.
